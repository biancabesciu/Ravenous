"Ravenous", a Yelp-like web application - first project of the Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch course from Codecademy.

A step by step project, built using JavaScript and React components.

The project is split into four parts:
 - Creating Static Components;
 - Passing Information to Components;
 - Setting the State of Ravenous Components;
 - Interacting with the Yelp API.

Overview of how Ravenous should function:
 - As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants;
 - As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API;
 - As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter.
